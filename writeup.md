Playing Thomas was alone, I appreciated the way in which the character personalities is reflected in their gameplay. The stuborn Chris moves slowly, with a small, weak jump. The proud and charismatic John leaps high into the air, the most capable of the group. Thomas is well balanced, his average size allowing him to fit in spaces John can't, while his average jump allows him to make leaps inaccessable to Chris. I wonder what the process for creating these characters. Did the personality inform the gameplay, or did the gameplay inform the personality? While I think of course there was a mix of both, I suspect that the gameplay more strongly influenced the personality than the other way around. Looking at the way the rectangles move, the human brain is wired to add some personality. If you imagine them as thinking, then every detail you can observe of these characters will inform how you imagine them to think. Additionally, for the sake of puzzle design, I'm sure it would be much easiser to create the characters neccessary for the platform puzzles you have in mind and then fill in the character blanks. Having to come up with a character and then design puzzles around those characters is much harder; if that's how the game was designed, massive props to the developer.
